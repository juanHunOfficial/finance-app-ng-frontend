This is a budgeting tool web application that allows users to track their expenses, categorize transactions, and manage their monthly budgets effectively. The app connects to a third-party API (yet to be decided) to fetch transaction data from the user's bank account, enabling them to categorize and track their expenses directly from the interface.

## Important to Keep In Mind

This project is purely front-end focused and will be using mock data to mimic the responses in the format I intend to receive from the back-end.

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **Angular**: A framework for building client-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript for static typing.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling for the frontend components.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for the backend.
- **Express**: A minimal web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user data, transactions, categories, and monthly sums.

### Third-party API:
- TBD (Third-party API to link and fetch bank transactions, e.g., Plaid or Yodlee).

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple, efficient tool for managing personal finances. The user can link their bank account using a third-party API, and the app will automatically fetch their transactions. From there, users can categorize the transactions (e.g., groceries, rent, entertainment, etc.) and track their monthly budgets. The app will also provide a monthly summary, giving users insights into their spending habits.

## Design

### Models:
The backend of the application is designed to have the following key models:

1. **User Model**:
   - Stores information about each user (e.g., name, email, hashed password).
   - Allows users to log in and manage their account.

2. **Transaction Model**:
   - Represents a financial transaction pulled from the third-party API.
   - Stores transaction details such as the amount, date, description, and associated category.

3. **Category Model**:
   - Categorizes transactions into specific types like groceries, rent, utilities, etc.
   - Each category is linked to multiple transactions.

4. **Monthly Sum Model**:
   - Tracks the total sum of transactions for each month.
   - Helps users track their overall spending against a set budget.

4. Install dependencies for the backend: 

    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    npm install
    ```

5. Set up environment variables:
  
  - For the backend, create a .env file in the server folder and add the required environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, API keys for third-party integrations, JWT secrets).
  
6. Run the application:

- Start the backend server:
  
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

- Start the frontend application:

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    
## Usage
